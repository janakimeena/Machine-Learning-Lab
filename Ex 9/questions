1. Download 2015 data from 
https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system

2. Find the dimension of the data

3. Choose randomly 100000 records only for classification

3. Include only numerical data for classification

4. Fill all the missing values with mean of their columns

5. _RFHLTH column is the target column

6. create a dataset with records having _RFHLTH values as 1 and 2

7. Check the following columns and remove if there is null value in more than 40% of records and if there is a skewness in the value. That if same values is present in more than 65% of records

8. split into train and test datasets

9. Create a random forest classifier with 100 trees and number of features = square root of number of features

10. Get the probability of predcition for class being 2

11. Find the train and test ROC AUC score

12. 	Find the Baseline ROC and state your observation
