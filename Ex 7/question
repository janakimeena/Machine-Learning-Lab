1. Take the car evaluation dataset from UCI repository
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation

2. Convert all fields into integer following the encoding scheme:
vhigh -> 4, high -> 3, med -> 2, low -> 1
2 -> 2, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 4, 5more -> 5,more -> 5
small -> 1, med -> 2, big -> 3
unacc->1,acc->2,good->3,vgood->4

3. Create training and test data

4. Train SVM model with linear kernel

6. Predict and plot the confusion matrix

7. Notedown your observations

8. Try the other SVM Kernels
